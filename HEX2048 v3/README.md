# Version 3 Update

## Changes

- Changed some global variables to local variables.
- Tiles are now generated using CSS.
- Added a Highscore feature (Highscore is saved in the browser memory separately for each radius).
- Introduced animations for new tile spawns and when tiles are moved or updated with a new value.
- Improved responsiveness to window size.

## Bug Fixes

- Tiles no longer spawn after a key press when nothing moves.
- Fixed an issue in the game logic where tiles from 4,4,2 would incorrectly change to 8,0,2, etc.
